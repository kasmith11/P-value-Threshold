## Description

Sample implementation of ["The p-value Requires Context, Not a Threshold](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00031305.2018.1529624?needAccess=true&role=button).

This implementation is based around example 1(a) of the paper, but can be used for other effect and sample sizes...

This implementation and paper also makes the assumption of the standard normal being used (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
